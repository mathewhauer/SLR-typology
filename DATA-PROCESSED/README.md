# Organization

No data is natively housed within this folder. In order to generate data, please run the scripts located in the `SCRIPTS` folder. These data are post-processed. After scripts are run, this folder will be populated with the following datasets:

`hammer_populations.csv` - contains the population point estimates in decadal increments for each block group for 1940-2010.
`hammer_populations_upperest.csv` - contains the population upper estimates in decadal increments for each block group for 1940-2010.

# Correspondence
For any issues with the functionality of the script please create an issue.
